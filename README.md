The concept of the "runtime weights" promotes the use of neural plasticity and attempts to bring about modular behavior in artificial neural networks.

This project is very rough work-in-progress.

For the moment, I would recommend going to this page and reading the documentation available to understand what all this project is about: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jason777/Research/Runtime%20Weights

Colin Green implemented SharpNEAT.
Kenneth O. Stanley implemented the original Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm.
