The concept of the "runtime weights" promotes the use of neural plasticity and attempts to bring about modular behavior in artificial neural networks.

This project is very rough work-in-progress.

For the moment, I would recommend going to this page to understand what all this project is about: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jason777/Research/

Although commits will soon take its place, looking through "Changes.txt" will reveal most information about how this differs from Colin Green's original implementation of NEAT.

Colin Green implemented SharpNEAT.
Kenneth O. Stanley implemented the original Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm.
