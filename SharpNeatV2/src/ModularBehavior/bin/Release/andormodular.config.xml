  <Description>
    AND-OR Modular Domain - The point of this simple experiment
    is to try and force a genome to implement modular behavior
    through the use of runtime weights. The experiment switches
    between evaluating a phenome against AND operations and OR
    operations.
    
    Fitness is set by how many operations have correct output.
